# Mech105_Algorithms

This page contains all of the algorithms I wrote during Mech 105 in my freshman semester of my undergraduate at Colorado State University. Each file contains a short description of the purpose, inputs, and outputs of the algorithm. The algorithms inclue:

* Simpson is an algorithm that uses Simpson's 1/3 Rule to estimate integrals
* falsePosition is a root finding algorithm that uses false position to find the root of a function
* linearRegression creates a linear regression line for a set of data (exluding outliers)
* luFactor uses gaussian elemination and pivoting to solve a system of equations
* specialMatrix creates a matrix of a specified size, with specific values on the diagonals
