# LU Factorization Algorithm

The algorithm luFactor uses Gaussian Elemination and pivoting to determine the LU factorization of a square matrix. The algorithm checks that the input matrix is square, and will work for both a matrix that requires pivoting and one that does not. 
* Inputs
  * A - the coefficient matrix
 * Outputs
   *  L - the lower triangular matrix with 1's along the diagonals
   *  U - the upper triangular matrix
   *  P - the stored pivot matrix
